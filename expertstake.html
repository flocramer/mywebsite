  <h1>Ancestral artefacts; an experts take</h1>
  <pre>
    For this research project a scholar in legacy studies with expertise in ancestral 
    artefacts has been so kind to let us ask some questions about the differences between 
    European and Australian or American customs and to discuss the Groninger museum .

    There were different themes that resurfaced during the interview that were discussed. 
    These varied from the norms differences between cultures and museums. How hard it is 
    to consider one set of rules for so many unique pieces of artefacts and how different 
    stakeholders with different mindsets might react or act in these situations.
