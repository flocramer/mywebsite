  <h1>Ancestral artefacts; an experts take</h1>
  <pre>
    For this research project, a scholar in legacy studies with expertise in ancestral 
    Artefacts has been so kind to let us ask some questions about the differences between 
    European and Australian or American customs, and to discuss the Groninger museum.

    Different themes resurfaced during the interview that were discussed. 
    These varied from the norms, differences between cultures, and museums. How hard is it 
    to consider one set of rules for so many unique pieces of artefacts and how different 
    stakeholders with different mindsets might react or act in these situations. 
    
    After explaining about the Groningen University museum, the interview discussed 
    how many museums do not display what the university museum has. It is 
    not usual custom in for example, Oceania or in North America, where different norms guide 
    the presentation of exhibitions and which artefacts are kept in storage. Due to the fact 
    there are no international guidelines or laws it is up to the local laws and individual
    museums ethical considerations for artefacts to be displayed or not. 
    Furthermore, the way of  exhibiting an artefact can make a difference and museums would actively 
    work toward an ethical and respectful exhibition while curating.

    <h2>Quotes from the interview: </h2>
<h3>“The actual return of objects is really the goal, and that's what people want” </h3>
<h3>“But the point is really to be respectful and to ask, …., rather than continuing the colonial 
  tradition of making decisions for these people, ask the people how they would like their artifacts 
  to be handled”  </h3>
