  <h1>INHIBITING FACTORS</h1>
  <h4>
Some reasons why museums are still displaying artefacts or not acting on criticism could be:
money 🤑💸💰,
staff 👨‍💼👨‍💼,
knowledge💭🤔📖,
means or space to store undisplayable artefacts📦📦

lets unpack this: 
  </h4>
<h3 style="text-align:left;">  1. Money as an inhibiting factor</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"> 
  Its sad to hear but oftentimes museums can not rely on their ticket sales as enough income for the museum to sustain. 
  This can also lead to little to no changes in exhibitions or the museum's display. To change there is the necessity 
  for staff to work on this, and for this staff to be paid. It could be that volunteers are a part of the working staff. 
  Volunteers can be incredibly useful and beneficial for a museum however they are not professionals. They are not involved 
  or possibly not educated on the museum's artefacts and their possible sensitivity. 
  
</p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left;">   2. Staff </h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"> 
 
  Another reason why museums might not change their exhibitions ties together with money as an inhibiting factor. For too
  little money can also lead to less staff members. It is the case that staff members have certain tasks that need to 
  happen such as work with visitors or give tours. There could be that there is not enough time to also be working on 
  changing exhibitions, texts or artefacts. The displays seemingly do not change until mor staff can help with the workload
</p> 
 
<h3 style="text-align:left;">  3. Knowledge </h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"> 
  As elaborated in ‘talk with expert’ changing or creating an exhibition takes a lot of expertise. Dealing with ancestral 
  artefacts requires lots of consideration for the origin of an artefact and the community it stems from. This knowledge 
  comes from these communities and ancestral experts such as anthropologists or archaeologists. Not every museum has access 
  to these experts or knows how to reach out to these communities. This could also be related to the initial point on how 
  money can stop such knowledge from being accessed. 
</p>


<h3 style="text-align:left;"> 4. Means or space to store undisplayable artefacts </h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"> 

  Many museums have artefacts in storage that can not be on display for many different types of reasons. It can also be the case that even with the appropriate knowledge communities that are contacted at the moment do not have the means to receive their artefacts back. However this can also be the case for museums, some artefacts require specific storage options to let artefacts breath or be stored after being blessed for example. This can contradict with the museums storage spaces or with their general means to hold or repatriate artefacts. As we learned from interviews with our experts, some communities request
