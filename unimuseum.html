  <h1>The university museum in Groningen; an interview with the director</h1>
  <pre>
    <h3 style="text-align:left;"> 
    The interview with the director of the University Museum highlighted the lack 
      of resources this museum was suffering of. It impacts the display of the collection, 
      but also the possibility to ethically store human remains. Although the museum 
      is in the process of restituting some of its collection, the director wants to 
      leave human remains accessible as they are part of the university’s history, also
      as the museum needs to draw visitors. He highlights the need to change the display
      of human remains but is still thinking about the way this should be done more ethically,
      taking into account the colonial background of these artefacts. The director also 
      explained how the display was the professional’s decision as well as the decision to 
      take cultural backgrounds into account.

    <h2>Quote from the interview:  </h2>
    <h3>“It is a small museum with a large collection and big responsibilities, and we cannot
      live up to all the expectations that have been raised” (Museum Director)
